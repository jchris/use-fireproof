# Documents

Fireproof uses JSON documents to store data. Documents are stored in a single collection, and each document has a unique ID. Documents can be read, written, and deleted. Validation functions can prevent unwanted changes from being written to the database.

## Document read and write

Fireproof uses a simple API for reading and writing documents. You can read a document by its ID, and write a document by passing it to the `put` function. The `put` function returns an `ok` response with the document's ID and clock.

### Read with `get()`

```js
await database.get("my-doc-id")
```

This returns a document with an `_id` field that matches the ID you passed in. If the document doesn't exist, it throws an error.

```js
const theDocument = await database.get("my-doc-id")
// { _id: "my-doc-id", hello: "world" }
```

### Create with `put()`

Creating and reading a document, where Fireproof generates a random ID:

```js
const ok = await database.put({ hello: "world" })
// { id, clock }
const theDocument = await database.get(ok.id)
// { _id: ok.id, hello : "world" }
```

If you don't specify an `_id` in your document body, Fireproof will generate one for you. That is what is returned as `ok.id` above.

### Update with `put()`

You can put to the same `id` over and over again, like this:

```js
theDocument.hello = "again"
const putResponse3 = await database.put(theDocument)
theDocument.hello = "universe"
const putResponse4 = await database.put(theDocument)
```

If multiple users are working this way, whoever writes last wins, overwriting the other changes. (Coming soon: multi-version concurrency control to provide more options.)

### Store files `put({_files : ...})`

If you add an upload `<input>` to your html like this:

```html
<input accept="image/*" title="save to Fireproof" type="file" id="files" multiple>
```

And an event handler:

```js
function handleFiles() {
  const fileList = this.files;
  const doc = {
    type: "files",
    _files: {}
  }
  for (const file of fileList) {
    // assign the File object to the document
    // under doc._files["myname.jpeg"]
    doc._files[file.name] = file
  }
  const ok = db.put(doc);
}

const fileInput = document.getElementById("files");
fileInput.addEventListener("change", handleFiles, false);
```

Fireproof will take care of encoding it to UnixFS, encrypting it, and replicating with your chosen storage backend. Files are synced outside the main database, so they replicate on-demand and then are made available offline via the database. By default the files are encrypted, so they are safe to store in untrusted storage. 

### Load file data 

Uploaded files are available as a `File` object, which you can access by calling the `file()` method on the file metadata.

```js
await doc._files["myname.jpeg"].file()
```

The document looks like:

```js
{
  _id: "my-doc",
  _files: {
    "myname.jpeg": {
      type: "image/jpeg",
      size: 12345,
      file: () => Promise<File>
    }
  }
}
```

In the example below, note how we use `await` to get the file from the promise, and also that we've wrapped each file in an async function so the images can load in parallel. The user of `revokeObjectURL` is important to avoid memory leaks. [Here is a React component that handles this](https://github.com/fireproof-storage/catbot/blob/cd8056121bc42fa71a078b8501b5cfb2ed4fc7b3/src/components/ChatBubbles.tsx#L79).

```js
const doc = await db.get(ok.id)

// adjust this for your app
const li = document
            .querySelector('ul')
            .appendChild(document.createElement('li'))

for (const file of Object.keys(doc._files)) {
  (async () => {
    const meta = doc._files[file]
    if (meta.file && /image/.test(meta.type)) {
      const img = document.createElement("img");
      img.src = URL.createObjectURL(await meta.file());
      img.height = 100;
      img.onload = () => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(img.src);
      };
      li.appendChild(img);
    }
  })();
}
```

#### Public Files

The public files API looks just like above, except you save to `doc._publicFiles` instead of `doc._files` and the files are not encrypted. This is useful for storing files that you want to share with the world, like images for your website. In addition to the `car`, `cid`, and `size` properties, public files also have a `url` property that you can use to access the file directly from the web3.storage content delivery network. 

The feature is designed to support systems like self-publishing blogs, which can write their own markdown to html output, reference assets, etc. The default encrpyted `_files` interface is better suited to social media sharing, field data collection, and other controlled access data sharing.

The public file feature is only available on the IPFS connector.

## Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) (available in alpha, coming soon in beta)

If you want to prevent that scenario, you can enable multi-version concurrency control, which will require that writers prove they are updating from the latest version, or else the write fails. This can give them a chance to reload from the source and incorporate their changes before writing, instead of doing it later as a conflict merge.

The put response includes an `id` which is unique for the document in the database, and a `clock` which represents the current snapshot of the database. You can also request that Fireproof inline the clock with the document by passing the `{ mvcc: true }` option:

```js
const theDocumentV4 = await database.get(putResponse.id, { mvcc: true })
// theDocumentV4._clock === putResponse4.clock
```

If the clock is inline in the document it will protect against writing with stale data. Here's what happens if another update comes in before the document loaded with `{ mvcc: true }`:

```js
theDocument.hello = "friends"
const putResponse5 = await database.put(theDocument)
// now theDocumentV4, which has _clock, is out of date
const putResponse5 = await database.put(theDocumentV4)
// throws new Error('MVCC conflict, document is changed, please reload the document and try again.')
```

In this way you can protect against users being surprised by accidental data overwrites.
